# **Industrial Robot - Pick and Place Line Follower**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on the development of an **Industrial Robot** that combines a **robotic arm** with a **line follower mechanism**. The robot can autonomously pick up objects from one location and place them at another while following a predefined path.


## **Features**
- **Line Follower Mechanism:** Uses **IR sensors** to detect and follow a path.
- **Robotic Arm:** Controlled using **Arduino Uno** and **servo motors** to pick and place objects.
- **Bluetooth Control:** The arm can be controlled remotely via an **Android application**.
- **Automated Movement:** Reduces manual labor and enhances industrial automation.

## **Working Principle**
1. The **IR sensors** detect the path and guide the robot along the predefined track.
2. The **robotic arm** picks up objects based on commands sent from the **Arduino Uno**.
3. The **Bluetooth module** allows remote control of the arm via a mobile app.
4. The **motor driver and DC motors** enable movement along the track.
5. The **servo motors** adjust the armâ€™s position for picking and placing objects.

## **Installation & Usage**
1. **Power the Circuit**: Connect the **9V and 12V batteries**.
2. **Control the Robot**:
   - The robot follows a predefined **line** automatically.
   - Use the **Android app** to control the arm remotely.
3. **Pick & Place Function**:
   - The robotic arm picks up objects from a defined location.
   - Moves to the next predefined location and releases the object.
